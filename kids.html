<p>2.On a lightly floured surface, roll pastry into a large rectangle, about 24 by 16 inches. Cut into 6 square pieces. Place an apple on each pastry square with the cored opening facing upward. Cut butter into 8 pieces. Place 1 piece of butter in the opening of each apple; reserve remaining butter for sauce. Divide brown sugar between apples, poking some inside each cored opening and the rest around the base of each apple. Sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg over the apples.</p>
<p>3.With slightly wet fingertips, bring one corner of pastry square up to the top of the apple, then bring the opposite corner to the top and press together. Bring up the two remaining corners, and seal. Slightly pinch the dough at the sides to completely seal in the apple. Repeat with the remaining apples. Place in prepared baking dish.</p>
<p>4.In a saucepan, combine water, white sugar, vanilla extract and reserved butter. Place over medium heat, and bring to a boil in a large saucepan. Boil for 5 minutes, or until sugar is dissolved. Carefully pour over dumplings.</p>

        <p>1 bunch Swiss chard, preferably red chard (about 12 to 16 ounces), washed
3 cloves garlic
1 pound fresh or frozen tortelloni
2 to 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar.

Grated Parmesan cheese</p>
          <p>1.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</p>

<p>6.Reserve one cup of the cooking water (carefully scoop it out with a ladle or a heat-proof measuring cup).</p>
<p>7.Drain the tortelloni in the colander.</p>
<p>8.In the same pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until starting to soften but without browning, about 30 seconds.</p>

        <p>Do this first:

Roll dough for one 15 to 16-inch pizza crust into a pizza pan or baking sheet. Use the Pizza-Pizza: Double-Dough recipe (it makes two crusts, but you only need one for this recipe), or use your favorite crust.
Thaw a 10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach or cook 1 pound cleaned spinach leaves and chop. Squeeze the water from the spinach until it's very dry (reserve the squeezed liquid for a soup or sauce). Young children can do this by placing the cooled spinach in a sieve over a bowl and pressing on it with the back of a wooden spoon, a spatula, or with clean hands.
Shred enough Swiss cheese to make 2 cups, or use pre-shredded cheese.</p>
          <p>1 cup cooked, chopped spinach, squeezed dry
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
Dash white pepper (optional)
2 cloves garlic
1 8-ounce can tomato sauce
1 prepared pizza crust, uncooked
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning (mixed dried herbs)
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan (optional)</p>
          <p>1.Heat the oven to 450 degrees.</p>
<p>2.Mix together the spinach, cheese, and a dash of white pepper in a bowl.</p>
<p>3.Peel and finely mince the cloves of garlic.</p>
<p>4.Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the crust.</p>
<p>5.Crush the Italian seasoning between your fingers and sprinkle over the sauce .</p>
<p>6.Arrange the spinach-cheese mixture on top of the sauce. Sprinkle on garlic.</p>
<p>7.Brush the edges of the crust with olive oil.</p>
<p>8.Bake until the crust is crisp and golden and the cheese melted, about 10 to 15 minutes. Let the pizza stand a few minutes before slicing. If desired, dust lightly with grated Parmesan. Serve hot.</p>
